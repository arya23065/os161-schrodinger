1. When a thread exits - The thread detaches from the current process, the stack-guard band is checked, to make sure that overflow 
    hasn't occured, the run queue is locked by acquiring the spinlock, if there's nothing to do, it returns, else the thread is 
    added to the list on the wait channel, the lock is released, and the thread is flagged as 'ZOMBIE'. Then, the next thread is obtianed. 

    When a thread sleeps - If in an interrupt handler, the thread is not allowed to sleep, else the iff and when the spin lock for the 
    specified wait channel is obtained, and no other spinlock is held, the cpu is yielded to another process ie. yield to another
    runnable thread, and the current thread goes to sleep on the specified wait channel. 

2. The function thread_switch handles a context switch.
