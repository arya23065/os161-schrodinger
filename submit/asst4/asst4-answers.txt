1. ELF magic numbers are:
0x7f, 'E', 'L', 'F'. These can be found in kern/include/elf.h, and are 
stored in e_ident[EI_MAG0...3]

2. UIO_USERISPACE is for process code, and UIO_USERSPACE is for process data.
We use UIO_USERISPACE when the memory block encapsulated by a uio is in user 
space and is executable. We can see this in kern/syscall/loadelf.c.
We use IUO_SYSSPACE for source/destination memory blocks in kernel space.

3. The file that is read is stored in memory starting at vaddr (kern/syscall/loadelf.c).
vaddr is stored in the uio struct that load_segment() creates, so it can be allocated on the stack
in load_segment().

4. Once we have loaded the executable, we don't need the file reference anymore. Moreover, if we don't
call vfs_close() before switching to usermode, other processes won't be able to execute the same program.
